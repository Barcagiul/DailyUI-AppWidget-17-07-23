Added info about my widget:
A gardening partner app widget. The app would work as a to-do list and monitoring system for users with their gardening. This widget would take the current weather and give the most suitable tasks for the user to do. It could also track how long since each task has been completed by the user as to give it a priority even if the weather may not suit, i.e. watering since it has been over ... days since last done. The widget is made just using CSS and HTML with no functionality
